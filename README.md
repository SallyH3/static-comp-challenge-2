# static-comp-challenge-2

I created this static comp project for module one at Turing Scool at Software and Design. I was asked to recreate the screenshot of the static comp below, which has grown in complexity when compared with static comp-1 project(the project that I created before this one). 
I was given creative license (copy, images, icons, and color pallette), however the objective was to build something that respected the integrity of the original design. I created the project with HTML and CSS (grid and flexbox). The project is responsive down to mobile screens of 320px. The site works across Firefox, Safari, Chrome as I used a normalize file in CSS.
